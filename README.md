# TriaxOS
operating system made by dumbass (me) in arround 2 months i think? anyways since development is on fedora i cannot create bootable iso but i can create a bootable image so yuh cool stuff and Triax is made in Assembly(boot loader and kernel) and C++/C (drivers in C and programs in C++) pls star this thing so i have motivation to update that thing.
